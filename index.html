Save on money, and time by switching to a green littler box alternative. Using wood pellets to create a green (compostable) litter. Using wood pellets as a cat litter by absorbing the liquid – along with the smell – and then crumble into sawdust. The sawdust ends up at the bottom of the litter box, while the fresh pellets remain on top. Sprinkle additional pellets on the surface to maintain the litter box. Feces are scooped away and removed daily.

In our professional opinion (backed on many studies practied over the years), declawing is cruel and unnecessary. This inhumane act is even banned in some countries.

Kitty lasers are proven to stimulate cat's brains and allow them to burn that excess energy they need to get out (for most cats, this will be every day). Not only is this toy great for a healthy brain, but it also helps curb obesity and high blood pressure. If your kitty over indulges in food and doesn't burn off the calories, this can be a serious health concern. " %}
