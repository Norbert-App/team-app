      Save on money, and time by switching to a green littler box alternative. Using wood pellets to create a green (compostable) litter. Using wood pellets as a cat litter by absorbing the liquid – along with the smell – and then crumble into sawdust. The sawdust ends up at the bottom of the litter box, while the fresh pellets remain on top. Sprinkle additional pellets on the surface to maintain the litter box. Feces are scooped away and removed daily.

  {% pattern sections/step-right image="bin.jpg" step="Step 1" step-minidescription="Two plastic boxes to be the litter box" step-description="You can go to Walmart (or any place that you know sells large plastic bins). When looking for bins you will want to make sure they are study and have handles for a better grip. They should be large enough for you cat to be able to fully fit with extra room to turn around; deep enough they can’t flick any of the wood pellets out and can jump out of easily. You don’t want a bin thats to deep where your cat cant’t get into. You also want to make sure when the bins are stacked that there is a gap between both the bins. This is for when you are sifting the littler the powder can fall to the lower bin and doesn’t block the holes you will be making." %}

  {% pattern sections/step-left image="drill.jpg" step="Step 2" step-minidescription="Using an electric drill with a bit attachement of your choise to creat holes in one of the plastic bins." step-description="Now that you have the bins we need to drill some holes in one of the bins so when the pellets turn to powder you can sift it to separate the powder from pellet. You can choose to measure them out in straight lines, or randomly. Make sure when making the holes they aren’t too big that the pellet themselves will not fall through, but large enough that the powder won’t clog them up. As an example of a bin that the bottom measure 15 inches in length and 10 inches wide. To prevent from loosing the structure of the bin you can separating each hole by 1 inch (makes about 150 holes). When drilling you can use a sharp bit, you will have to push down on the plastic to puncture it to make the hole. Be carful when doing this step. You can use a scrap piece of wood that you can drill into if you don’t feel comfortable flipping the bin up-side-down to drill. Clean out all the extra bits of plastic and you are ready fort the nest step." %}

  {% pattern sections/step-right image="wood-pellets.jpg" step="Step 3" step-minidescription="Wood Pellet litter or Pine Litter" step-description="Now that we have the bin made we need some pellets to fill it with. Some facts you might want to know about wood pellets before starting this journey. Clay litter isn’t an ideal choice, there can be a lot of chemicals added to clay litter, it can be tracked back into the house causing more of a mess, some don’t actually clump or hold in the oder, and the major one is it usually ends up in landfills. Wood pellets or pine litter, comes from the waste product of lumbar mills. Their saw dust thats is heated and stroked into the pellet like shapes that expand back into saw dust when they get wet. Major factor is pine litter is compostable. The user experience about pin litter is you need a sifting litter box (which if you follow the above two steps we just made one). When looking for wood pellets or pine litter you can go to a Canadian Tire and can get wood pellets for a wood burning stove (about $6 for 40 lbs) which will last much longer then clay and be much more cost effective." %}

  {% pattern sections/step-left image="waste-bin.jpg" step="Step 4" step-minidescription="Using the litter, and making the adjustments" step-description="A waste bin is a good idea if you don’t want to keep going out to your compost every time you need to empty the litter. Now that we have the bin and the pine litter, and a waste bin time to use this magical contraption. Heres the T on how to transition you cat to wood pellets. When getting started you will want to put some of the clay litter you have left mixed with the pine litter, mixing it at a 50/50 ratios to start. This is so the cats recognize the smell and learn to use the new litter we have so abruptly changed on them. Make sure to keep an eye on the little for the first usage and to reward your cat once they do their business in the new litter. Once they use it more and more you can just wait for the clay litter to sift tot the bottom and just add more pellets slowly. Once you are at a 90/10 ration of wood pellets you can clean out the litter and put only wood pellets(remember each cat is different it may take longer or shorter for you cat to adjust, be patient and don’t rush the process). When you start to only use wood pellets you can scoop out the poop that will be sitting on top into the waste bin, and sift the pee that has turned the pellets into powder down into the lower littler box. Once the lower level is full you can empty this into the waste bin that can then be composted, and refill the upper sifter with more pellets if needed." %}

        Overall every cat is different and will adjust to this change in different speeds. Be patient and remember to reward you feline for using this new toilet. This hack will save on so much money per year and makes a greener impact. Also if you like the smell of wood or a lumber yard then this will smell just like that.
